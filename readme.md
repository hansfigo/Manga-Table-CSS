# Manga Table CSS

This project is a case study where i utilize CSS tables to display the manga list dynamically. i implement API call in this project so the manga list is dynamically generated and not manually generated. by using typescript in this projectt im able to catch errors and bugs early in development progress and lead to a maintainable and clead code.

## Web
